    description: "The Volkswagen Taos is a compact crossover SUV introduced first in Mexico in 2020 and in the United States as a 2022 model year vehicle. Positioned below the Tiguan in Volkswagen's lineup, the Taos fills the entry-level SUV slot in markets where the T-Cross is not offered. Built on the MQB platform, it features a squared-off, traditional SUV design language that aligns with Volkswagen's larger SUVs. In North America, the Taos is powered by a 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 158 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission in front-wheel drive models or a seven-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic in all-wheel drive variants. The interior offers a blend of practicality and technology, with a standard 6.5-inch or available 8-inch infotainment touchscreen, optional 10.25-inch Digital Cockpit instrument cluster, and two-tone leatherette upholstery in higher trims. Despite its compact exterior dimensions, the Taos provides generous passenger and cargo space, with over 28 cubic feet of storage behind the rear seats. Available driver assistance features include forward collision warning, autonomous emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, and adaptive cruise control. The Taos has proven popular in North America, providing the utility of an SUV with the efficiency and maneuverability of a smaller vehicle."
