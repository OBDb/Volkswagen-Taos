    description: "The Volkswagen Taos is a compact crossover SUV that debuted in October 2020 for the North American market as a 2022 model year vehicle. Built on the Volkswagen Group MQB A1 platform, it is positioned below the Tiguan in the lineup and serves as an indirect replacement for the discontinued Golf. For the North American market, power comes from a 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder TSI Evo engine producing 158 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque at 1,750 rpm. Front-wheel-drive models feature an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the 4Motion all-wheel drive variants use a 7-speed DSG dual-clutch transmission. The Mexican-built Taos features Volkswagen's Digital Cockpit system with a reconfigurable 12.3-inch display, MIB3 infotainment with either a 6.5-inch or 8.0-inch touchscreen, and available wireless charging. Standard safety features include forward collision warning, autonomous emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, and adaptive cruise control. The Taos offers over 28 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats and is available in S, SE, and SEL trim levels."
